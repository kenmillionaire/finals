For TeamBadgerw2, follow the following steps to collaborate:

    Visit the Repository to the Project on Github Website: https://github.com/TeamBadgerw2/alumni_donate

    Fork the repository: Click the "Fork" button on the upper right corner of the Repo page.*

    Make a local clone: Click on the "Code" button on the Repo page Copy the URL for the forked Repo "https://github.com/TeamBadgerw2/alumni_donate.git" 
    
    Create a Folder on your Local machine / Computer for the project Workspace Open Command prompt / Terminal in the same folder location In your Terminal, type:
    git clone https://github.com/github_username/proj_debtors-team-36.git

    Open terminal and set upstream branch:
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/TeamBadgerw2/alumni_donate

    Pull upstream to get up to date with the original repo:
    git pull upstream main

    Create a new branch for the task you are working on :
    git checkout -b branchName
    (Make sure your branchName is descriptive in context to the feature you are working on. 
    Also be sure to check which branch you are on using git status before you begin working)

    When you're done with your task, do:
    git add
        Commit your work with a message:
        git commit -m "message"

    To avoid conflicts:
    git pull upstream main

    Then push your branch:
    git push origin branchName - This creates the branch remotely and pushes to that branch on the Github

    Go to Github and create a new pull request to the main branch. It will then be reviewed and merged into the master.

If you need to make an update, repeat from no 4
